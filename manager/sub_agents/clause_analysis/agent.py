#     You are a domain-aware contract clause analysis agent for a Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) system.

#     Your task is to identify the presence and completeness of key legal clauses in a given contract based on the domain it belongs to. You must verify that essential clauses exist, are contextually relevant, and are worded to reduce legal and operational risk.

#     GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
#     - Perform a thorough semantic search to detect clause presence even if phrasing varies.
#     - Be cautious of vague or undefined language; clauses must be explicit and scoped.
#     - Identify any clause that appears incomplete, irrelevant, or contextually mismatched.

#     DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CLAUSE CHECKS:

#     1. TECH DOMAIN:
#         - Confirm the presence of Service Level Agreements (SLA), Data Ownership, Third-party liability, IP rights, and Confidentiality clauses.
#         - Check for any vendor lock-in, performance penalties, uptime guarantees, and data transfer terms.

#     2. HEALTHCARE DOMAIN:
#         - Ensure clauses include: HIPAA-related Confidentiality of PHI, Indemnification for medical errors, Clinical trial responsibilities, and Ethical review obligations.
#         - Identify Data retention policies, licensing terms for medical software/devices, and cross-border data sharing.

#     3. FINANCE DOMAIN:
#         - Confirm presence of clauses on Audit Rights, Termination for Convenience, Regulatory Compliance, Force Majeure, and Payment Disputes.
#         - Validate conditions around Fraud detection, AML safeguards, arbitration, and escrow arrangements.

#     SCORING AND OUTPUT:
#     - Begin with a score of 100. Deduct 10 points per major missing or incomplete clause.
#     - Output format must be structured and human-readable with bullet points.

#     Example Response:
#     "Clause Analysis Report (Tech):\n
#     - Found: SLA, Data Ownership\n
#     - Missing: Third-party liability\n

### Clause Analysis Report ‚Äî Domain: Tech

---

#### üìå Summary of Findings:
- **Domain Classification:** Technology (Tech)
- **Contract Reviewed:** ‚ÄúMaster SaaS Agreement ‚Äì CloudStack Inc.‚Äù
- **Total Mandatory Clauses Evaluated:** 5
- **Optional Clauses Evaluated:** 3

---

#### ‚úÖ Detected Clauses:

- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):**  
  Clearly defines system uptime (99.95%), incident response timelines, and escalation matrix. Includes penalties for non-compliance.

- **Data Ownership:**  
  Specifies that all customer-generated data remains the sole property of the client and outlines provisions for data export upon contract termination.

- **Confidentiality:**  
  Includes bilateral non-disclosure terms, definitions of confidential information, and outlines permissible disclosures.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete or Missing Clauses:

- **Third-party Liability:**  
  ‚ùå Missing entirely. No language assigning responsibility for failures or breaches caused by third-party vendors or partners. This exposes the client to indirect liability.

- **Intellectual Property (IP) Rights:**  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially defined. Mentions deliverables belong to the service provider but lacks clarity on jointly developed tools or white-labeled software. Risk of future IP dispute exists.

- **Optional ‚Äì Product Manager Review Clause:**  
  ‚úÖ Present. Notes involvement of the product team in quarterly performance evaluations.

#### üîç Clause Evaluation Table:

| Clause Name                   | Mandatory | Status     | Completeness | Remarks |
|------------------------------|-----------|------------|--------------|---------|
| Service Level Agreement       | ‚úÖ         | Detected   | Complete     | Meets industry benchmarks |
| Data Ownership                | ‚úÖ         | Detected   | Complete     | Clearly protects client interests |
| Confidentiality               | ‚úÖ         | Detected   | Complete     | Includes NDAs and permissible exceptions |

| IP Rights                     | ‚úÖ         | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Incomplete   | Ambiguity in shared IP |
| Product Manager Clause        | Optional  | ‚úÖ Present | Complete     | Good addition for collaboration visibility |

---

#### üõë Legal & Operational Risk Summary:

- **High Risk:** Missing clause on Third-party Liability may result in unclear risk allocation if subcontractors fail to meet standards.
- **Moderate Risk:** Vague IP language could lead to disputes on ownership of enhancements or integrations.
- **Low Risk:** No immediate compliance violations; all confidentiality terms align with standard SaaS contract models.

---

#### üìä Scoring Summary:

| Evaluation Metric                          | Weight | Score |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| Presence of Mandatory Clauses              | 40%    | 30/40 |
| Completeness & Clarity of Clauses          | 30%    | 21/30 |
| Alignment with Domain Standards            | 10%    | 10/10 |
| Legal & Operational Risk Mitigation        | 10%    | 6/10  |
| Inclusion of Optional / Domain Best-Practices | 10%    | 8/10  |
| **Total Score**                            | 100%   | **75/100** |

---

#### ‚úÖ Final Verdict:
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Review Required  
The contract covers a majority of required clauses but is missing the third-party liability clause and contains ambiguity in IP ownership language. It is recommended that these issues be addressed prior to legal approval and execution.

---

#### üìö Recommendations:
- Insert a standard ‚ÄúThird-party Liability‚Äù clause that assigns accountability to subcontractors and affiliates.
- Clarify ownership of derivative works and jointly developed IP assets in the IP clause.
- Proceed with Legal Team review before routing for executive sign-off.
